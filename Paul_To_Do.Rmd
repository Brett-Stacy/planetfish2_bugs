## Tasks for Paul

### 1.
Run TOA_bug_1.R for one iteration (don't run plot chunk at end). OK to change file path.

look at the warnings at the end. Does the one about NAs mean anything to you?



### 2. 
the thing with tag age frequency overlaping catch not matching up.



### 3.
Can you go through the settings related to biomass like para\$ass\$estim_initialization.B0 to see if they are reasonable for my lower value of recruitment (and subsequent biomass).
  
  
  
### 4. 
Can you go though my match function and see if there is anything missing?


### 5. 
Only when I manually calculate SSB for the OM does it line up with the SSB from CASAL. Why would this be the case for TOA and not for TOP?


### 6.
Why in res output do all ssb0 calculation methods equal the same number?
