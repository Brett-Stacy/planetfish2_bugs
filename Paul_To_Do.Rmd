## Tasks for Paul


### 
Run your model with flounder life history parameters. Run a scenario you know worked for your TOP migration paper but with different LHPs and plot the SSB for OM and AM. 
- find LHPs for Paul.

###
Run Phill's model with different LHPs






## Ideas for Paul
### 
the thing with tag age frequency overlaping catch not matching up.



### 
Can you go through the settings related to biomass like para\$ass\$estim_initialization.B0 to see if they are reasonable for my lower value of recruitment (and subsequent biomass).
  
  
  
### 
Can you go though my match function and see if there is anything missing?


### 
Numbers at age each year between the OM and AM match very well. If this is the case, then shouldn't SSB be the same between the two if they are calculated at the same time in the model sequence?
- need to show Paul numbers at age are similar. 

### 
Only when I manually calculate SSB for the OM does it line up with the SSB from CASAL. Why would this be the case for TOA and not for TOP?
